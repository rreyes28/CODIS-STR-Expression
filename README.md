Taken from our ASHG 2020 Abstract:

The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) loci are short tandem repeats (STRs) selected by the FBI in the 1990s to be used in genetic profiling for criminal cases. These loci were chosen for their efficient replication via PCR and for demonstrating high genetic diversity, making them a small yet powerful set of variants for differentiating individuals. In an effort to protect medical information, the CODIS STRs were to be located in ‘junk’ DNA so that no trait data could be inferred from a forensic profile. However, the human genome was not fully sequenced until 2003, which revealed that some of these loci are located close to genes and some are even intronic. Additionally, we know that length variation in STRs has been linked to some genetic disorders. A classic example of this occurrence is Huntington’s Disease (HD) in which the exonic STR expansion in the HD gene causes increasingly severe Huntington’s Disease phenotypes. Given what we know about the human genome sequence and function, along with population datasets of transcriptomic and genetic variation, here we revisit the question of whether the CODIS markers themselves can reveal medically relevant information. 

Our study aims to answer whether the CODIS STRs’ length variation is influencing gene expression levels and, therefore, potentially revealing medically relevant information.
